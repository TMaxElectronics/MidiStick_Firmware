# MidiStick - The worlds most advanced midi interrupter
Its a USB stick sized MIDI over usb compatible interrupter for tesla coils.
It generates the pulses that control the arcs.

This Repo contains the Firmware it uses, the PCB files are [here](https://github.com/TMaxElectronics/MidiStick_PCB)

# What are the features?
It is a four-voice polyphonic synthesizer that supports the VMS (Versatile Modulation System), which allows it to work pretty much like a normal synthesizer with a square wave output does. It supports free modulation of the key signal parameters on the fly (frequency and on time), ring modulation, fully range-mappable use of free midi CCs as parameters for the modulations and midi maps (allowing for different VMS sequences for every note). This is fully customizable with a graphical programming language and can be used to create sound effects like for example a drum kit.

The hardware is usb stick sized (hence midiSTICK ;) ) and can be used with both HFBR and IF-E96E series transmitters.
